# AES-Crptography-Final-Year-Project
Top Class AES Encryption and Decryption Cryptography Project. B.tech Final year project for the College Students.  

AES is very secure ‚Äî virtually unbreakable

The AES algorithm (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) is a symmetrical block cipher algorithm that takes plain text in blocks of 128 bits and converts them to ciphertext using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits. Since the AES algorithm is considered secure, it is in the worldwide standard.

AES algorithm uses a 128-bit symmetric, or single-key, block cipher that encrypts and decrypts information. The AES encryption process creates ciphertext, which is an unreadable, effectively indecipherable conversion of plaintext data, the version of information that humans can read and understand. The output of the encryption process, the AES ciphertext, cannot be read until a secret AES key is used to decrypt it.
